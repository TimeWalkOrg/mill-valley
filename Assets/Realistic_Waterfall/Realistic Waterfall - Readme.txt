This Realistic Waterfall provides a beautiful tumbling waterfall, complete with texture animations, mist particles, splash particles and UV scrolling.

Simply drag the Waterfall prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

The effect includes audio, however if you wish to disable this then expand out the the effect in the Hierarchy window (click the grey triangle to left of its name), select the audio file, then untick it in the Inspector window (the top left of the window).

You may wish to tweak the particle effect to your taste. To do this, simply select an element of the waterfall in the Hierarchy window, and then alter any of its variables in the Inspector window. A good place to start would be the Rate (under Emission), Start Size and Start Speed.

Have fun!
